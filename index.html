            <h3>Jubilee Austen Project<br>HTML 5 and CSS Website</h3>
            <p> This is my first HTML and CSS project. I was given a design comp and used Photoshop to create the website. With some step by step help, I was able to match colors, fonts, and images from the comp to create a beautiful new website!</p>

            <p> This is my second project. I was given the design comp in Photoshop and had to create the website on my own. This website features divs, backgrounds, fun fonts, and more!</p>

            <h3>Recipe Cards Project<br>HTML 5 and CSS Exercise with Floating</h3>
            <p>This project was a bonus lesson where I created three recipe cards from a design comp. The main focus of this project was to be able to apply a variety of backgrounds as well as float div elements flawlessly on a webpage.</p>

            <p> I am a former middle school English teacher. I currently live in Bourbonnais, Illinois with my husband and three children. I have always loved technology and coding. After feeling stuck and unhappy in my former career, I did some searching and came across web design and development. I looked into it some more and came across SkillCrush. I was thrilled to see they offerecd courses for exactly what I wanted. I was so happy to see that I would be able to make a career out of coding websites.  Those course paired with my IT Support Specialist certificate from Coursera makes me an ideal candidate for any company. I am so excited to have a career I am passionate about and that will allow me to support my family and work from home!</p>
